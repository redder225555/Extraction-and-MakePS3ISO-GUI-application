## Running in Terminal

To see real-time logs and error messages, it is recommended to run the app from a terminal:

```sh
python Main.py
```

Or, if you built with PyInstaller:

```sh
cd dist
./Main.exe
```

This will keep the terminal open so you can see all output, including progress, errors, and debug info.

## Troubleshooting
- **DLL Not Found:** Ensure all required DLLs are in the `DLLs` folder under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/PS3Utils`.

- **Missing Dependencies:** Install all required Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if provided).
- **7-Zip/WinRAR Not Detected:** Set the correct path to the executable in the Extraction Software tab.
- **For more help:** Open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redder225555/Extraction-and-MakePS3ISO-GUI-application/issues).
